# Code Labs Academy - CSS Challenges Part 02

## Introduction

This is one of the coding challenges for the Fundamentals unit of the web development bootcamp offered by [Code Labs Academy](https://codelabsacademy.com/). In this unit, we learn the major concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript while providing challenges and homeworks for an optimal hands-on learning experience.

## Challenge description

This repository contains a set of CSS-related tasks designed to go along with The CLA's HTML and CSS content. These tasks are mainly focused on [CSS Animations](./animation/), [CSS Flex layout](./flex/) and [CSS Grid layout](./grid/).

- When doing these challenges, please use all the documentation and resources you need to accomplish them. You are _not_ intended to have any of this stuff memorized at this point. Check the docs, use Google, do what you need to do (besides checking the solutions) to get them done.

- Before beginning any work, make sure to carefully read the `README.md` for each exercise. There is a checklist in each `README.md`. Rely on it to check that you didn't forget to implement any crucial details.

- Make the necessary changes to the `index.html` and/or `style.css` files to get your browser to display the output in the manner you want it to. You might only need to edit one of these files, depending on the exercise's instructions.

**Happy coding! ðŸ˜„**
